# Loopy Belief Propagation
Belief propagation is a message-passing algorithm for performing inference on graphical models such as [Markov random fields](https://github.com/hpcanalytics/Markov-Random-Field).It calculates the marginal distribution for each unobserved node, conditional on any observed nodes.  
# Exemplar application
[Project:3D reconstruction of tourist attractions from social media images](http://vision.soic.indiana.edu/projects/disco/) is one case of using belef propagation to solve a real problem.
