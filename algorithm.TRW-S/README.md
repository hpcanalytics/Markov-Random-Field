# Tree-reweighted Message Passing
The Tree-reweighted Message Passing algorithm use ordinary BP on trees and node averaging which breaks the [Markov Random Filed](https://github.com/hpcanalytics/Markov-Random-Field) into several monotonic chains, and perform belief propagation (BP) on each chain.
# Exemplar application
[Project:3D ice bed reconstruction](http://vision.soic.indiana.edu/papers/icesurface2017icip.pdf) is one case of using mcmc to solve a real problem.
